# NSDC-Biology-Track
Predicting cancer risk (categorical) based on many numerical features for different risk factors. Lends itself well to logistic regression.

**Project Overview:**
Analyze patient-level numerical health indicators to understand how different risk factors relate to overall cancer risk level. The project is regression-focused, with opportunities for both predictive modeling and exploratory analysis.

Patient-level data with multiple numerical features representing measured risk factors, and a categorical outcome variable indicating cancer risk level (Low / Medium / High).
